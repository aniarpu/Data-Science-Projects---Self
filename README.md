# Data-Science-Projects---Self

PROJECT - 1
Built a 2 layer and 3 layer neural network and trained them using Gradient Descent. The 2 layer network has 3 input neurons and one output neuron.
The 3 layer network has 3 input neurons, 4 neurons in the hidden layer and one output neuron. 

PROJECT - 2
Analysed the Titanic dataset on Kaggle and achived a classification accuracy of 0.79425. I created new features from the existing data and used Grid Search to tune the Hyper Parameters and find an optimum model. The classification model used is Random Forest.

PROJECT - 3
Analysed the San Francisco crime dataset and achieved a multiclass loss score of 3.66356. Again new features were created and the hyper paramters of the model were tuned using Grid Search. The classification model used is Random Forest.

The projects were done in Python using the libraries Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Patsy and Matplotlib
